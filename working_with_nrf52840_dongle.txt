working with nrf52840 dongle


use nrf connect - its easier than nrfutil 
nrfutil dfu usb-serial -pkg app_dfu_package.zip -p COM7 -b 115200

need some way of debugging - should develop on the dk and then transfer is easy (just a few lines in the makefile?)

bootloader adds an extra complication


If get into issues with nrf connect (e.g. libusb error) or not recognising it then can reset by pushing the small reset button (not the big one!) while plugged in and it should start flashing red
